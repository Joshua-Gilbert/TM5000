# TM5000 Control System v3.4

## Version 3.4 - 1024-Sample Buffer Upgrade with Memory Optimization
*Released: July 2025*

Building on the enhanced stability of v3.3, version 3.4 implements the planned 1024-sample buffer upgrade while achieving significant memory optimization through comprehensive buffer management improvements.

## üîß Key Features

### New in V3.4
- **1024-Sample Buffers**: Enhanced from 1000 to 1024 samples per module for optimal FFT performance
- **Memory Optimization**: 22% reduction in runtime memory usage despite enhanced capacity
- **GPIB Buffer Optimization**: Reduced from 256‚Üí128 bytes saving ~6KB of memory
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Smart buffer allocation only when needed
- **Bit-Packed Configurations**: Optimized boolean storage in configuration structures
- **Power-of-2 Alignment**: Native 1024-point FFTs eliminate zero-padding overhead

### From V3.3 (Inherited)
- **Fixed Critical Stack Overflow**: Module selection menu no longer crashes
- **Eliminated Symbol Conflicts**: Removed 7 duplicate function definitions
- **Fixed Configuration Loading**: Modules now load reliably from .cfg files
- **Fixed Measurement Data Loading**: .tm5 files load without errors
- **Improved File I/O**: Eliminated unreliable fseek operations
- **Enhanced Stability**: Zero linker warnings, clean compilation

### From V3.2 (Inherited)
- **Stable Base**: Built on proven v3.1 module loading and FFT fixes
- **Enhanced Configuration**: Module-specific settings saved between sessions
- **Advanced Units System**: Smart priority (dB > frequency > voltage)
- **Complete Counter Support**: Full DC5009/DC5010 GPIB implementation
- **Crash-Free FFT**: Fixed cursor crashes, display artifacts, and grid scaling

### From V3.1 (Inherited)
- **Module Support**: All TM5000 modules (DM5010/5120, PS5004/5010, DC5009/5010, FG5010)
- **Advanced Functions**: FFT analysis, statistics, waveform math
- **Professional Printing**: PostScript and text output with proper units
- **Smart Memory**: Automatic and manual allocation management

## üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

### Stack Overflow and Memory Corruption
- **Problem**: Module selection menu caused PostScript output, garbage, and crashes
- **Root Cause**: Multiple functions defined in different files causing symbol conflicts
- **Discovery**: 7 functions had duplicate definitions across modules
- **Solution**: Eliminated all duplicate symbols, maintained single source of truth
- **Impact**: Module selection works reliably, zero linker warnings

### Configuration and Measurement Data Loading
- **Problem**: Files would fail to load with modules not appearing after loading
- **Root Cause**: `fseek(fp, -strlen(line), SEEK_CUR)` fails in DOS buffered I/O
- **Solution**: Eliminated all fseek operations in file parsing
- **Impact**: Both .cfg and .tm5 files now load reliably

## üìã System Requirements

- **Computer**: Gridcase 1520 or compatible DOS system
- **Memory**: 640KB RAM minimum
- **Graphics**: CGA graphics adapter
- **GPIB**: National Instruments GPIB card with DOS drivers
- **DOS**: MS-DOS 5.0 or higher recommended
- **Compiler**: OpenWatcom C/C++ 1.9 (for rebuilding)
