  - Added division by zero protection in FFT frequency calculation (ui.c:1325)
  - Added NaN detection for invalid x_scale values
  - Added fallback protection in FFT freq_resolution calculation
  - MAJOR: Fixed grid display crash when dB units become dominant (graphics.c:744-769)
  - Added special dB grid labeling logic to handle negative dB ranges properly
  - FFT traces now display safely when volts traces are removed

### üìù Enhancements
- **287 Math Coprocessor Optimizations** (per scientific programming guide)
  - Implemented Kahan summation for high-precision accumulation
  - Added 287-safe trigonometric functions with proper range reduction
  - Enhanced FPU precision control (extended 64-bit mode)
  - Improved Taylor series approximations for software fallback
  - Fixed accumulation errors in integration and smoothing functions

- **Enhanced Floating Point Drift Correction**
  - Replaced log10/pow operations with precise lookup table
  - Added 287-specific machine epsilon thresholds
  - Enhanced precision detection using double arithmetic
  - Optimized engineering value snapping for 1-2-5 scales
  - Reduced false corrections with adaptive thresholds

- **Enhanced Units System** 
  - Added Hz/MHz/GHz units for counter and FFT traces
  - Added dB units for FFT Y-axis display
  - Implemented intelligent FFT peak centering during generation
  - Added frequency X-axis support for FFT spectrum analysis
  - Smart unit priority system (dB > frequency > voltage)
  - Enhanced readouts with appropriate units per trace type

- **DC5009/DC5010 Counter Enhancements**
  - Added complete GPIB command set per programming guide
  - Implemented query commands (FUNC?, ID?, ERR?)
  - Added TIME AB/BA and EVENTS BA specific commands  
  - Enhanced with TOT A+B/A-B modes for DC5010
  - Added manual timing (TMAN) and propagation delay (PROB A&B)
  - Implemented Service Request (SRQ) and status byte support
  - Added preset function (PRE ON/OFF) and extended range calculations

- Graph display now supports two methods to toggle traces:
  - Press 'T' for trace selection menu (recommended)
  - Use ALT+0 through ALT+9 to toggle individual traces

### üî® Build System & Compilation
- **Added Missing GPIB Function**
  - Implemented ieee_spoll() function in gpib.c for DC5009/DC5010 status polling
  - Added ieee_spoll() declaration to gpib.h 
  - Resolves linker error for counter status byte functions
  - Executable: tm5000.exe (175 KB) successfully built
